# Swanton Ranch AI

A voice assistant for visitors of the Swanton Pacific Ranch, primed to answer common questions about the region. The architecture is modeled off of Nimbus, with the added benefit of working offline as a self contained unit.

Due to the Santa Cruz Lightning Complex Fires, the club is delaying deployment of any voice assistants on the ranch property.
