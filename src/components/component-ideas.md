# Component Ideas

## Stack

**A small list view of technologies**

- Has icon of the language/library
- Name across from icon
- Stack should be organized front end to back end
- Name section could have bar above with percentage of use
- Clicking on a technology should send user to documentation or explainer.

**Use Case:**

Each team page should show off their stack to educate users.

## Contact Cards

**Contact link to a knowledgeable member**

- Profile image on left.
- name headline in bold
- subhead title in medium below headline
- clicking links to person's github
- Icons for multiple means of communication?

**Use Case:**

Help new members get in contact with team leads.

## Carousel

**A browsable series of images**

- This one is just a classic [carousel implementation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/)

**Use Case:**

Show off something cool!

## Footer navigator

**Navigate through the document flow**

- A short header/footer element centered on page with a prev and next button.
- Each button labeled by their associated article.
- Should look something like [this](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Bower)

**Use Case:**

Every article in a subsection should be able to easily jump to the next article or the previous article.
