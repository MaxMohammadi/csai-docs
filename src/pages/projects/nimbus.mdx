# Nimbus

The Nimbus voice assistant is an ongoing project providing Cal Poly students with an easily accessible resource to answer academic questions.

## Vision

We noticed that our peers struggled with picking classes and navigating through Cal Poly's admission system. Usually we ended up pooling our common knowledge to help each other make optimal decisions. We made Nimbus to be the ultimate pool of knowledge. It draws data from a myriad of university-related sites, feeding a constantly growing knowledge base, which the user can query through an intelligent AI.

Nimbus was made with the following intention in mind:

- Help students navigate through the Cal Poly experience.
- Educate students about the Cal Poly campus.
- Connect students with clubs and organizations.
- Keep students up to date with variable information, like office hours and schedules.
- Make class exploration easy.

## Try It Out

The text box below is hooked up to the Nimbus virtual assistant. Ask it a question or generate one from our list.

## Tech Stack

The Nimbus ecosystem consists of several different sub projects working together to provide a conhesive user experience.

## Nimbus API

<InlineFlex>
  <LibraryPill
    name="Flask"
    invertOnDark={true}
    icon={flaskIcon}
    link={libraryLinks.python.FLASK}
  />
  <LibraryPill
    name="SQL Alchemy"
    icon={sqlAlchemyIcon}
    link={libraryLinks.python.SQLALCHEMY}
  />
</InlineFlex>

The API routes data and requests to the correct locations. Our apps communicate with this modue via HTTP REST API requests, which call functions in Python that perform a specific action. For Nimbus users, the API routes questions to the NLP model for parsing. Club members use other endpoints to store and validate data. API functions uses a SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the MySQL database. The ORM maps SQL rows in a table to Python classes, allowing developers to modify the database without writing SQL queries. After the requested action is performed, the API sends back a response. This can be a bundle of requested data, a confirmation of a sucessful action, or an error if something went wrong.

**TODO Example**

## Nimbus NLP Model

<InlineFlex>
  <LibraryPill
    name="Scikit Learn"
    icon={sklearnIcon}
    link={libraryLinks.python.SKLEARN}

  <LibraryPill
    name="Tensorflow"

    link={libraryLinks.python.TENSORFLOW}
  />
</InlineFlex>

The K Nearest Neighbors Natural Language Processing model allows us to map questions to the closest known answer in our knowledge base. The model recieves the question as a string from the Nimbus API. It converts the phrase into blocks called tokens, which are words grouped around semantic meaning. These tokens are encoded into numbers, which are used to represent a point in n-dimensional space. By finding the closest point to our question through cosine similarity, we can link the user's question to a known question. By looking up this known question in the database, we can find the corresponding answer.

## MySql Database

The database is mostly a simple storage utility which keeps track of our question/answer knowledge base, user feedback and scraped data. Database developers are provided with individual logins in order to keep the database secure.

## Nimbus Chat

Nimbus Chat is a chatbot built in Vue that allows students to query our model through the browser.

## Nimbus Voice Assistant

The Nimbus Voice Assistant is a voice user interface written in python running on a Raspberry Pi with a custom hardware chasis. It allows users to interact with Nimbus by saying "Nimbus" followed by a question. The device uses Google's speech-to-text engine to convert the audio and then sends the strigified question to the Nimbus API for processing. When it recieves an answer from the Nimbus API, it uses a text-to-speech engine to read the answer aloud to the user.

## Web Scrapers

Our web scrapers are responsivle for keeping the Nimbus knowledge base up to date. The system watches a variety of Cal Poly informational websites and extracts useful data for the NLP model to reference.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Course</td>
    <td>Units, pre/corequisites, terms offered, GE areas, description.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Professors</td>
    <td>Courses taught, email phone number, title, department, office, office hours, research interests.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clubs</td>
    <td>Type, description, contact person/email/phone, advisor, affiliation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sections</td>
    <td>Start/end times, locations, instructor, type, days, department.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## CSAI Recorder

The CSAI club needs to collect a bunch of data to develop our machine learning models. CSAI Recorder is a web app that allows us to crowd source data collection. It provides a guided experience that helps people enter and label their own data. Users can contribute wake word samples which are used to help Nimbus recognize its own name. They can also add to our knowledge base by requesting questions and providing answers. The CSAI Recorder sends the collected data to the Nimbus API to be routed to the database.

## Nimbus Validator

Crowd sourced data has to be validated before it can be used. The Nimbus Validator is a React web app that allows club members to easily access and clean unvalidated data. It enforces best practices and helps correct common errors. After validation, information is automatically integrated into the active Nimbus knowledge base.

## QA Objects

The behavior necessary to answer a question is stored in that question's QA object, which contains functions for retrieving necessary data from the database, formatting the data, and outputting an answer.
Creating QA objects can be time-consuming, so a simple meta-language was created to turn plain-text question and answer formats stored in a Google Sheet into QA objects. Simple questions can be easily added by adding a new row in the sheet, and QA objects for more complex questions can still be manually created and used.

Formats are simple sentences with some special tokens.

Special tokens are in square brackets [] and have key words separated by two periods

`ENTITY` can be `PROF`, `COURSE`, or `CLUB`.

`[ENTITY]` will be substituted with the name of the extracted entity.

`[PROF] -> "Khosmood"`

`[ENTITY..PROPERTY]` will be substituted with the property of that entity from its main table in the database

`[PROF..email] -> foaad@calpoly.edu`

`[ENTITY..PROPERTY..TABLE]` will search for that entity in a different table. Currently, this isn't super useful, but `TABLE` can be any `ENTITY` or `PROF_SECTION` to search in the sections table.

`[ENTITY..PROPERTY..JOINER]` will find all matches to `ENTITY` in its default table, make a list of the matching `PROPERTY`, and grammatically join them with `JOINER`.

`JOINER` will pretty much always be "and" or "or", and when I say "grammatically join" I mean join like:

`["CPE 202"] -> "CPE 202"`
`["CPE 202", "CPE 203"] -> "CPE 202 and CPE 203"`
`["CPE 202", "CPE 203", "CPE 357"] -> "CPE 202, CPE 203, and CPE 357"`

`TABLE` can be any of the `ENTITY` types, as well as `PROF_SECTION` for section information.

Finally, `[ENTITY..PROPERTY..TABLE..JOINER]` will find all matches to `ENTITY` in `TABLE`, make of list of the matching `PROPERTY`, and grammatically join them with `JOINER`.

This lets us answer questions about sections like, "What sections does [PROF] teach?"

`[PROF..section_name..PROF_SECTION..and] -> "CSC 491_15, CSC 492_15, CSC 482_01, CSC 378_04, CSC 378_03, CSC 482_02, CSC 400_15, CPE 461_30, and CSC 498_15"`
